Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.\\n\\nAnother form of uncooked pizza is available from [[take and bake pizzeria]]s. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold to customers to bake in their own [[Conventional ovens|ovens]].

On deck ovens, pizza can be slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a [[peel (tool)|peel]], and baked directly on the hot bricks or baked on a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum). Prior to use, a peel may be sprinkled with cornmeal to allow pizza to easily slide onto and off of it.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmI2YJ1vMxMC&pg=PA3 | title=Make Great Pizza at Home | publisher=Taste of America Press | author=Owens, Martin J. | year=2003 | pages=3 | isbn=0-9744470-0-5}}</ref> When made at home, it can be baked on a [[pizza stone]] in a regular oven to reproduce the effect of a brick oven. Another option is [[grilled pizza]], in which the crust is baked directly on a barbecue grill. [[Greek pizza]], like Chicago-style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.\\n\\nWhen it comes to preparation, the dough and ingredients can be combined on any kind of table. With [[mass production]] of pizzas the process can be completely automated. Most restaurants still use standard and purpose built pizza preparation tables.
